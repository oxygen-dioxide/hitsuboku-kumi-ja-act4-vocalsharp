Currently please don't create pull requests, especially those about .vsdxmf files. Because vsdxmf files are generated from oto.ini by my python script each time I build this voicebank. If you want to fix a bug or implement a function, Please [create an issue](https://github.com/oxygen-dioxide/hitsuboku-kumi-jpn-act4-vocalsharp/issues/new) to let me know.
